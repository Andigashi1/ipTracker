## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned a bit about API since this is my first time working with one. The ip grabber was very easy to learn however leaflet.js took me a bit of time to understand and i had to through a lot of trial and error to make it work.

### Continued development

I plan on working more with API-s on my next projects as i learn by doing, and i want to learn react router in order to make multi-page websites.

### Useful resources

- [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) - I used both this site and the one that tells you how to integrate it in React
